class TShock():
    """The main API wrapper. This class handles all requests.
    The functions in this class document what endpoint they belong to
    and have names that describe their functions.

    All of the functions beginning with ``get_`` do not edit any server values.
    ``get_`` functions simply query the TShock server using any of the REST endpoints
    that do not update, create, or delete data. An example is returning a list of players.
    Of CRUD, ``get_`` covers Read.

    All of the functions beginning with ``set_`` will edit some sort of value on the server's end.
    ``set_`` functions are used to update, create, or delete data. An example is banning a player.
    Of CRUD, ``set_`` covers Update.

    All of the functions beginning with ``do_`` will perform some sort of action that
    will edit the TShock server's state somehow, but will not cause permanent changes.
    These are typically actions taken somehow. An example is butchering all NPCs.
    Of CRUD, ``do_`` covers Create and Delete.

    All of the functions will return a dict. The dict is a mapping of the JSON data
    returned by the TShock server as a REST response. Every response will contain the
    ``status`` member. The ``status`` member is the HTTP status code that the TShock server
    returned. Any statuses other than 200 and 400 will not be returned and will instead
    be thrown as ApiExceptions. Most of the mappings returned will have a ``response``
    member. This indicates success or failure and the best way to find out what
    the mapping will contain would be to consult the REST API source or documentation.

    After instantiation, the :py:meth:`get_token` function should be run to obtain a token
    corresponding to a specific user. All requests will pass the token. You cannot
    make most requests without a token.

    Your user is required to have the appropriate permission assigned to them by the TShock
    server for some requests. These permissions are not documented here and may be found in the
    TShock RESTful API documenation:
    https://tshock.atlassian.net/wiki/display/TSHOCKPLUGINS/REST+API+Endpoints#RESTAPIEndpoints-/v2/users/activelist

    Example usage of the API:

    >>> tshock = pyshock.TShock()
    >>> tshock.get_token("Ijwu","test")
    >>> tshock.get_active_user_list()
    {'status': '200', 'activeusers': 'Ijwu'}
